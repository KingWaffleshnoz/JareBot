In that same regard, speech considered hateful or otherwise unhealthy for the server's atmosphere is heavily subjective; consequently, speech that you find appropriate may not always be appreciated by your peers. With this in mind, please be conscious of how your words might affect those around you."

Don't post anything nsfw, stick the appropriate content in their respective channels, confine bot usage to #bot-console, and use the designated text channels when participating in voice calls."
